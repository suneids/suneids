<h2 align="center"><bold>🛠 Engineering Roadmap: From Sensors to Exoskeletons</bold></h2>

## Phase 1: Anatomy (Jul 2025 - Feb 2026)

**Focus**: Sensor Fusion, Bare Metal Basics, Low-Level Protocols.

- [x] [**Project**: Car v2.5 — STM32, PWM, Basic Radio (HC-05).](https://github.com/suneids/Car)
- [x] [**Project**: Glove MK2 — MPU9250 Fusion, DMA/ADC, Soft UART, Gesture Recognition.](https://github.com/suneids/Glove)
- [ ] **Skill**: PCB Design — Transition from 2-layer to 4-layer boards (EMI/EMC focus).

## Phase 2: Biomechanics (Feb 2026 - Feb 2027)

**Focus**: Inverse Kinematics (IK), Robotics, Custom Actuators.

- [ ] **Innovation**: Custom cable-driven tension sensors with integrated encoders.
- [ ] **Project**: Quadruped (MK1) — 4-leg movement, basic stability.
- [ ] **Project**: Hexapod (MK2) — Remote presence, 18-DOF control, IK implementation.

## Phase 3: Advanced Robotics (Feb 2027 - Feb 2028)

**Focus**: Complex Systems, Aesthetics, Advanced Integration.

- [ ] **Project**: Octopod (MK3) — Dwarven-style design, high-torque locomotion.
- [ ] **Project**: The Mask — Integration of sensors, voice/visual feedback, and base for the manipulator.
- [ ] **Project**: The Third Arm (Viktor/LoL Style) — Shoulder-mounted manipulator integrated with the Mask's control system.
- [ ] **Skill**: Cyber-Aesthetics — Blending FreeCAD mechanical design with ergonomic wearable forms.

## Phase 4: Integration (2028 - 2029)

**Focus**: Human-Machine Interface (HMI) & Exoskeletons.

- [ ] Project: Full Exoskeleton Movement System — Merging glove control, IK, and high-power actuation into a wearable frame.
